As we journey back in time to the ancient civilizations that once ruled the Earth – the Egyptians, Greeks, Mayans, and even the druids of old – we see a common theme. It’s a secret language that weaves itself into the architectural wonders, mystical rites, and spiritual practices these societies held in reverence. This language is Sacred Geometry, an intrinsic part of the cosmic blueprint, which they believed can be harnessed to channel the divine and manifest desires.
Here lies the fascinating truth! They held a profound belief that this esoteric knowledge could align them with the greater universe’s vibrational frequencies and patterns.The fascinating world of crystals and their vibrations was discovered much before the advent of our current era. Prehistoric cultures – from the ancient Egyptians to the Aztecs – recognized the profound power housed within these unassuming, yet mesmerizing natural formations.
They understood that these stunning structures held within them an energy, a vibration, that could align with our personal frequencies, influencing our physical reality and instigating manifestation. Isn’t that wonderful?
Just imagine! The most unsophisticated of societies, using the raw beauty of unpolished gems to harness their inherent vibrations for manifestation, healing and protection.
They crafted jewelry, amulets, weapons and even lined their burial chambers with these sparkling stones, attesting to the deep-seated belief in their other-worldly power. Picture a prehistoric society, drawing upon the energy of these natural wonders, and applying it to manifest their deepest desires. What a magical idea!From Egyptian hieroglyphs to Greek philosophers, this incredible skill of crafting mental imagery has been a potent tool for thousands of years, underlining the critical role played by our mind’s eye to shape our destiny.
This is not just historic hearsay; evidence abounds in the annals of history! Scholars suggest that visualization was crucial in helping ancient sea navigators map intricate journeys across treacherous seas, relying solely on the power of imagery.
Furthermore, it was a common belief among the sages of yore that by visualizing an event, one could impart it with an essence of reality. This made it a significant tool for manifestation and setting the stage for the laws of attraction that we still use today. How exciting is that?!

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-5 mb-2 text-primary" id="the-new-thought-movement">The New Thought Movement</h2>
          <p class="text-lg">The late 19th and early 20th centuries marked a pivotal moment in the evolution of manifestation through the New Thought movement. This philosophical shift centered on the belief that positive thinking and personal beliefs could profoundly shape one’s experiences. Influential figures such as Helena Blavatsky, Thomas Troward and Prentice Mulford were instrumental in this movement, with some of their messages overlapping modern manifestation teachings<div class="dropdown dropdown-top dropdown-end "><a tabindex="0" role="button" class="link link-primary">[2]</a><div tabindex="0" class="absolute dropdown-content card card-compact p-2 shadow-xl bg-base-100 base-content max-h-80 w-56 lg:w-80 overflow-y-scroll border-2 border-primary z-10"><div class="card-body text-lg"><p class="card-title">Reference [2]</p><p><b>Title:</b> Law Of Attraction History: Discovering The Secret Origins </p><p><b>Url: </b><a class="link link-primary break-all" href="https://thelawofattraction.com/history-law-attraction-uncovered/" target="_blank">https://thelawofattraction.com/history-law-attraction-uncovered/</a></p><p><b>Highlights: </b>The 19th century arguably marked the beginning of the New Thought tradition. In turn, this led to concepts like manifestation entering the public consciousness. While a number of authors played key roles in this crucial developmental period, Helena Blavatsky and Thomas Troward were among two of the most significant.
Helena Blavatsky gave spiritual instruction and guidance across a huge range of different countries in the 19th century. By this time she had a reputation for being extremely spiritually gifted. She drew on ancient religious traditions to write a book called The Secret Doctrine. Much of what she believed overlapped with what we now call The Law of Attraction.
In particular, she contended that our thoughts about ourselves and our identity are what define who we are and what we’re capable of. She emphasized our ability to shape reality, and our power to move past our own limitations.
Both of these messages are found in contemporary manifestation teachings.</p></div></div></div><div class="dropdown dropdown-top dropdown-end "><a tabindex="0" role="button" class="link link-primary">[1]</a><div tabindex="0" class="absolute dropdown-content card card-compact p-2 shadow-xl bg-base-100 base-content max-h-80 w-56 lg:w-80 overflow-y-scroll border-2 border-primary z-10"><div class="card-body text-lg"><p class="card-title">Reference [1]</p><p><b>Title:</b> The Fascinating History of the Law of Attraction </p><p><b>Url: </b><a class="link link-primary break-all" href="https://www.lawsofattracting.com/history-law-of-attraction/" target="_blank">https://www.lawsofattracting.com/history-law-of-attraction/</a></p><p><b>Highlights: </b>- The term “Law of Attraction” appeared in print in 1877 by Helena Blavatsky.

The Origins of The Fascinating History of the Law of Attraction
The history of the Law of Attraction goes way back. It begins with ancient societies and their philosophies.
Old beliefs show that different cultures saw a link between our minds and the world.
Ancient Practices and Beliefs
Ancient civilizations thought our thoughts could change reality. For example, the Egyptians and Babylonians2. They believed our thoughts and energy could directly affect what happens around us. This idea was the start of the Law of Attraction.
In the late 1800s, Prentice Mulford was one of the first to talk about the Law of Attraction. He wrote about it in “The Law of Success”3. He suggested that what we think about deeply influences our lives3.
Early Philosophical FoundationsThe Law of Attraction has deeply touched our society, showing its might through countless achievements. People share stories of greater joy, fulfillment, and stronger bonds due to these principles. Optimists, focusing on their wins over losses, report better health and success5.
A study by Negros Oriental State University in 2018 revealed more happiness and thankfulness in people after a 29-day Law of Attraction course6.
Personal Success Stories
Many have shared how the Law of Attraction changed their lives. By focusing on positive thoughts and images, they’ve seen career and personal gains. Happy people tend to find more success in relationships, work, and health6.
These stories show how the Law of Atraction stays relevant in today’s world.

           <p class="text-lg">  As the 20th century progressed, the notion of manifestation gained further popularity, influenced by various self-help and motivational writers. Napoleon Hill's "Think and Grow Rich," published in 1937, became a cornerstone of manifestation literature, popularizing the Law of Attraction and emphasizing the power of belief and positive thinking. Since then, numerous authors and spiritual teachers have further shaped the contemporary understanding of manifestation, combining these teachings with elements from psychology and neuroscience, aiming to provide a more comprehensive approach to personal transformation<div class="dropdown dropdown-top dropdown-end "><a tabindex="0" role="button" class="link link-primary">[3]</a><div tabindex="0" class="absolute dropdown-content card card-compact p-2 shadow-xl bg-base-100 base-content max-h-80 w-56 lg:w-80 overflow-y-scroll border-2 border-primary z-10"><div class="card-body text-lg"><p class="card-title">Reference [3]</p><p><b>Title:</b> The Root of Modern Manifestation: A Journey from New Thought to the Law ... </p><p><b>Url: </b><a class="link link-primary break-all" href="https://www.anuttara.org/post/the-root-of-modern-manifestation-a-journey-from-new-thought-to-the-law-of-attraction" target="_blank">https://www.anuttara.org/post/the-root-of-modern-manifestation-a-journey-from-new-thought-to-the-law-of-attraction</a></p><p><b>Highlights: </b>The roots of modern manifestation can be traced back to the New Thought movement of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This philosophical movement emphasized the power of positive thinking and the idea that our thoughts and beliefs can shape our experiences. Figures like Phineas Quimby, Mary Baker Eddy, and Emma Curtis Hopkins were instrumental in developing these ideas, which later influenced the self-help and personal development movements.
Napoleon Hill and the Law of Attraction
Another significant influence on modern manifestation was Napoleon Hill, whose landmark book "Think and Grow Rich" (1937) introduced the concept of the law of attraction to a wide audience. Hill's work popularized the idea that our thoughts and beliefs can attract corresponding outcomes into our lives. According to the law of attraction, focusing on positive thoughts and beliefs can lead to positive results, while negative thoughts can manifest undesirable outcomes.

In recent years, the concept of manifestation has gained widespread popularity as a method for achieving personal and professional goals. From books to seminars to social media influencers, the idea that our thoughts can influence our reality has captured the imagination of many. But where did modern manifestation practices originate, and how do they compare to the manifestation principles found in the world of traditional Tantra?

It’s known by different names around the world (for example, hui in China, or stokvels in South Africa) but the underlying premise is the same – a group of people saves an agreed upon amount to a collective pool on a specific day, which could be payday or the first of the month. The system works in turns – on the first turn, one member of the group receives the money as a pay-out, and on the second, the next member, and so on – until all members have had their turn. No new money is created, but it’s a collective way for a group to save.

As a broad generalisation, Western societies tend to be more individualist whereas Eastern societies tend to be more collectivist (although the extent to which this is true will vary by country).

Critics argue that this narrative detracts from the valid contributions of cultural norms and broader socio-economic dynamics, potentially leading to misguided self-help philosophies that fail to address the root causes of inequality<div class="dropdown dropdown-top dropdown-end "><a tabindex="0" role="button" class="link link-primary">[31]</a><div tabindex="0" class="absolute dropdown-content card card-compact p-2 shadow-xl bg-base-100 base-content max-h-80 w-56 lg:w-80 overflow-y-scroll border-2 border-primary z-10"><div class="card-body text-lg"><p class="card-title">Reference [31]</p><p><b>Title:</b> The intersection of culture and wealth - American Experiment </p><p><b>Url: </b><a class="link link-primary break-all" href="https://www.americanexperiment.org/magazine/article/the-intersection-of-culture-and-wealth" target="_blank">https://www.americanexperiment.org/magazine/article/the-intersection-of-culture-and-wealth</a></p><p><b>Highlights: </b>In the arena

An economist looks for the roots of prosperity in cultural norms and beliefs.
There is a large and growing body of pseudo-academic literature arguing that “if we truly believe that all humans are equal, then disparity in condition can only be the result of systemic discrimination.” Scholars working in economic growth, by contrast, find many causes for “disparity in condition,” including disparities in cultural norms. As economist Oded Galor argues in his recent book The Journey of Humanity: The Origins of Wealth and Inequality:Cultural traits — the shared values, norms, beliefs and preferences that prevail in a society and are transmitted across the generations — have often made a significant impact on a society’s development process. In particular, aspects of culture that dispose populations towards or away from the maintenance of strong family ties, interpersonal trust, individualism, future orientation and investment in human capital have considerable long-term economic implications.
Some cultural norms, then, are more conducive to economic prosperity than others. But what happens when we mix cultures with different norms? That is the question Garett Jones, an economist at George Mason University, explores in his new book The Culture Transplant: How Migrants Make the Economies They Move To a Lot Like the Ones They Left.</p></div></div></div>.</p>
